## Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the application displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has `DEVOUR IT!` and `DELETE!` buttons. When the user clicks them, the burger will move to the right side of the page or be deleted from the database.

* The application stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
